			Hewn the from carcass of an oak tree and tempered in the fires of Vesuvius, songwriter Zack Adams breaks new creative ground daily, apparently just by existing. One day, he saw a log in a hearth, crackling alight. He made that into pop music. He gathered mountains into rock music. Entire cultures he birthed into folk music. His lyrical flow came from the oceans of Jupiter's moon, Europa. The relationship between his mother, Scheherazad, and his father, Orpheus, was a scandal. Young Zack was abandoned in the Wilderness and raised by coyote and platypus. It was the creatures of the wild that shaped his prodigious talent into the modern sounds now common to Western music. Guitars' knees go weak at a mere glance. His touch liquifies them. A strum and they are resolved to a singularity that swallows all and nothing. He'll be playing a toilet near you. </br>
