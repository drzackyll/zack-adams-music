				Zack Adams is a songwriter and singer living in Brooklyn, New York. He was born in Clinton, New York, and raised in North Carolina and Kentucky before going on to college and all that. In his early years, Adams was encouraged to explore music: first as a piano student, then as a choir boy, later as a saxophone player. He fell for rock and roll during his adolescence and became a student of its history. He taught himself how to play his college roommate's guitar and was hooked.

				<p>While the music bug caught him early, only recently did he decided to properly release some work. He celebrates is debut release, Forethought EP, a quick four-song set intended to capture some of the frustrations and developments of the beginning of adulthood. He is responsible for all music, lyrics, instruments, and production.</p>
